The results should hopefully be self-evident, and not requiring a detailed breakdown or further explanation here. 
All values are given in a.u. unless stated otherwise.





Noble gas dimer output data.

Columns are scale factors from the eq. interatomic distance (unitless)
Rows are specific functional & dispersion corrections
Data is given as C6 values (a.u.)

"MBD_C6" indicates the starting point for MBD, which is the TS method. "MBD_SCS" indicates the C6 value after the rsSCS process.
