For TS and MBD, results are given as a beta value, followed by dispersion energies for Ar-Ar, He-Ar, He-He, He-Ne, Ne-Ar, Ne-Ne. 
For XDM-C6, the Rsep, C6, and critical damping radius from the BJ damping function for Ar-Ar, He-Ar, He-He, He-Ne, Ne-Ar, Ne-Ne. 

The dispersion corrections' energies is combined with a PW86PBE energy to get the total energy, then the RMSPE is compared to the refdata.
Full XDM was already previously fit in another work using similar methodology, so those results are omitted.

PW86PBEenergy = {-85.2, -19.1, -9.2, -9.0, -21.5, -15.3};
REFenergy = {454., 93.7, 34.8, 66.0, 211., 134.};

TS and MBD were fitted by fine-scanning beta values to get the lowest RMSPE.
XDM was fitted by writing the RMSPE as a function of a1 and a2, assuming a1,a2>0, and solving for the global minimum.
