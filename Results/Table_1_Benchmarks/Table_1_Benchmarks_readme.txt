Here are the results for the LM11, LM26, and S66x8 benchmarks, as shown in Table 1.

For LM11 and LM26, there are summary results for MBD-NL, TS, and XDM. In the 3 columns of data, the first is the reference energy, the second is the calculated energy (in meV), and the third is the unit cell area of each layer in A^2.

For S66x8, only the results for MBD-NL are presented. The TS, MBD, and XDM results were previously calculated in Chem. Sci., 2023,14, 1252-1262 ( https://doi.org/10.1039/D2SC05997E ).
